> A lyrics api which actually works!

> It scrapes the lyrics from [Google](https://www.google.com/).

# In your code:

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save lyrics-finder
```

## Usage

```javascript
const lyricsFinder = require('lyrics-finder');
(async function(artist, title) {
    let lyrics = await lyricsFinder(artist, title) || "Not Found!";
    console.log(lyrics);
})("shakira", "chantaje");
```

# Command line usage:

## Using without installation

```bash
npx lyrics-finder "dream theatre" "another day"
```

> Note: Use this method only if you plan to use lyrics-finder for one time, installing lyrics-finder globally (see-below) is recommended for multiple time usages.

## Installation

```bash
npm install lyrics-finder -g
```

> Note: **DO NOT** use sudo to install global packages! The correct way to do it is to tell npm where to install it's global packages: `npm config set prefix ~/.local`. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is added to `PATH`.

## Usage after installation
 
```bash
lyrics-finder "dream theatre" "another day"
```

# API

It takes two arguments, artist name and song name and returns the lyrics as a string if found, else it will returns a null value (if used in code). The CLI binary logs the lyrics on your console (stdout) if found, else it will log 'Not Found!'.
